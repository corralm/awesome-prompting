# ðŸ’¬ Awesome Prompting

Prompt engineering involves designing effective queries for large language models (LLMs) to generate desired outputs. This guide shares a catalog of patterns and techniques for getting better results from LLMs.

> Creativity and an openness to exploration are really, really important with these tools. The creativity of the human that's putting in the words for the prompts, who's deciding what goes into that prompt, what gets asked, and what instructions are given are fundamentally important for using these tools effectively. â€“ Dr. Jules White, Vanderbilt University.

## Prompt Pattern Catalog

Prompt patterns are instructions guiding AI responses for specific tasks and are defined by core *contextual statements* that enhance the precision and relevancy of an output from an LLM.

There are six categories of prompt patterns in the classification framework defined in [A Prompt Pattern Catalog to Enhance Prompt Engineering with ChatGPT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11382).

## Prompting Techniques

Prompting techniques and strategies help guide LLMs and generally boost output performance.

- [N-Shot Prompting](#n-shot-prompting)
- [Chain-of-Thought](#chain-of-thought-prompting)
- [ReAct](#react-prompting)

[Back to the TOC](#table-of-contents)

### N-Shot Prompting

N-shot prompting encompasses different methods of interacting with LLMs, based on providing *N* examples before a query. The goal is to guide the model's responses, with the effectiveness varying based on model size, training data, and task complexity. This includes:

- zero-shot (no examples)
- one-shot (one example)
- few-shot (several examples)
- many-shot (numerous examples)

Examples:

```text
Question: "What is the capital of the United States?"
Answer: "The capital of the United States is Washington D.C."

Question: "What is the capital of France?"
Answer: 
```

```text
Beginning: "Once upon a time, in a kingdom far away, there was a brave knight named Arthur."
Ending: "After many battles, Arthur defeated the dragon and saved the kingdom."

Beginning: "In the dense forests of the north, a cunning fox named Ray lived."
Ending: "Using his wit, Ray outsmarted the wolf and proved that brains could win over brawn."

Beginning: "In the heart of bustling New York, lived a timid pigeon named Pete."
Ending: 
```

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Chain of Thought Prompting is a method where prompts guide a LLM through a line of reasoning, like a conversation. It involves a series of related questions that lead up to the main task. This method gives the model time to "think".

Examples:

<figure>
  <img width="800" alt="chain-of-thought-examples" src="./images/chains-of-thought.png">
  <figcaption>Examples of âŸ¨input, chain-of-thought, outputâŸ© triples for arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning benchmarks. Chains of thought are highlighted.</figcaption>
</figure>  

See Figure 3: [Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11903.pdf)

### ReAct Prompting

ReAct combines reasoning and actions to improve how LLMs think and make decisions. This method helps LLMs make better action plans and understand difficult situations. It also allows LLMs to use information from outside sources. ReAct does better than other methods on many tests.

Examples:

<figure>
  <img width="1000" alt="ReAct comparison" src="./images/react-prompt-comparisons-1.png">
  <figcaption>Comparison of 4 prompting methods, (a) Standard, (b) Chain-of-thought (CoT, Reason Only), (c) Act-only, and (d) ReAct (Reason+Act), solving a HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018) question.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img width="1000" alt="ReAct comparison" src="./images/react-prompt-comparisons-2.png">
  <figcaption>Comparison of (a) Act-only and (b) ReAct prompting to solve an AlfWorld (Shridhar et al., 2020b) game.</figcaption>
</figure>  

See Figure 1: [ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629.pdf).
